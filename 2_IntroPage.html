            Globally, about 25% of the worldâ€™s population struggles with this issue, with 771 million people without clean water access close to home.

            Light Water is a dynamic art installation to raise awareness for clean water accessibility challenges. We hope to serve as a focal point for public education, engagement, and advocacy.
