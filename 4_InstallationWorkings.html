                  Water quality is shown in three categories: a blue color and slow wave motion to represent a great water quality, 
                  a yellow-orange color and medium wave animation to represent fine water quality, and a red color and quick wave animation to represent
                  a bad water quality. The color and speed of light animation are key components differing each state of water quality. 
                  This design was created in response to public feedback, making sure that color and motion efficiently and clearly express quality of water data.

                  The motion of the water bottles is accomplished through individual linear actuator modules driven by servo motors. 
                  The vertical motion of each bottle is controlled by one such module, with a single servo driver board controlling
                  all the motors at once. Just like all the other electronics in the installation, 
                  external power will be obtained through a wall outlet connection which the servo driver would distribute to the motors. 
                  The motors we are using are the FEETECH FS90R continuous rotation servos, which run at 6V. 
                  We opted to use these instead of typical positional servos as the continuous rotation makes it very easy for us to adjust the 
                  range of motion of our actuators. The servo driver we are using is the Adafruit PCA9685 16 channel 
                  PWM Driver which communicates with our ESP32 through I2C.

                  The two main sensors we used in testing water samples were a pH sensor and a turbidity sensor. 
                  Monitoring pH levels is crucial for assessing water quality, as it indicates the acidity or alkalinity of water. 
                  For this purpose, we utilize a Gravity Analog pH sensor, which operates by measuring the voltage generated during the exchange 
                  of H+ ions between the solution being tested and the glass membrane of the electrode. Turbidity, on the other hand, measures 
                  water clarity and the presence of suspended particles, providing essential insights into water quality.
